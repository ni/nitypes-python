# Contributing to `nitypes`

Contributions to `nitypes` are welcome from all!

`nitypes` is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream
repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/nitypes-python/).

`nitypes` follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a
branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

Please remember to sign off your commits (e.g., by using `git commit -s` if you
are using the command line client). This amends your git commit message with a line
of the form `Signed-off-by: Name Lastname <name.lastmail@emailaddress.com>`. Please
include all authors of any given commit into the commit message with a
`Signed-off-by` line. This indicates that you have read and signed the Developer
Certificate of Origin (see below) and are able to legally submit your code to
this repository.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more details.

# Getting Started

To contribute to this project, it is recommended that you follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
   [installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Install `nitypes` dependencies using `poetry install`
4. Run the regression tests on your system (see Testing section). At this point, if any tests fail,
   do not begin development. Try to investigate these failures. If you're unable to do so, report an
   issue through our [GitHub issues page](http://github.com/ni/nitypes-python/issues).
5. Write new tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that these new tests fail.
6. Make your change.
7. Run all the regression tests again (including the tests you just added), and confirm that they
   all pass.
8. Run `poetry run ni-python-styleguide lint` to check that the updated code follows NI's Python
   coding conventions. If this reports errors, first run `poetry run ni-python-styleguide fix` in
   order to sort imports and format the code with Black, then manually fix any remaining errors.
9. Run `poetry run mypy` to statically type-check the updated code.
10. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository's `main` branch. GitHub Pull Requests are the
   expected method of code collaboration on this project.

# Testing

In order to be able to run the `nitypes` regression tests, your setup should meet the following minimum
requirements:

- Machine has a supported version of CPython or PyPy installed.
- Machine has [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

To run the `nitypes` regression tests, run the following command in the root of the distribution:

```sh
$ poetry run pytest -v
```
